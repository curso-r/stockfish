#' Stockfish engine
#'
#' @description This class represents a Stockfish engine, allowing the user to
#' send commands and receive outputs according to the UCI protocol. In short, a
#' `fish` object, when created, spawns a detached Stockfish process and pipes
#' into its stdin and stdout.
#'
#' For more information, see the full documentation by running `?fish`.
#'
#' @section Bundled Stockfish:
#' This package comes bundled with
#' [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish), a very popular,
#' open source, powerful chess engine written in C++. It can achieve an ELO of
#' 3516, runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS and Android, and can be compiled in
#' less than a minute.
#'
#' When installing `{stockfish}` (lower case), Stockfish's (upper case) source
#' code is compiled and the resulting executable is stored with your R packages.
#' This is not a system-wide installation! You don't have to give it
#' administrative privileges to run or even worry about any additional software.
#'
#' The only downside is that the bundled version of the engine is Stockfish 11,
#' not the most recent Stockfish 12. This is because the 12th version needs
#' additional downloads, which would dramatically increase the installation time.
#' If you want to, you can [download](https://stockfishchess.org/download/) the
#' version of your choosing and pass the executable as an argument to
#' `fish$new()`.
#'
#' @section UCI Protocol:
#' UCI (Universal Chess Interface) is an open communication protocol that
#' enables chess engines to communicate with user interfaces. Strictly speaking,
#' this class implements the
#' [UCI protocol](http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html) as
#' publicized by Stefan-Meyer Kahlen, just with a focus on the Stockfish engine.
#' This means that some methods are not implemented (see Common Gotchas) and
#' that all tests are run on Stockfish, but everything else should work fine
#' with other engines.
#'
#' The quoted text at the end of the documentation of each method was extracted
#' directly from the official UCI protocol, so you can see exactly what that
#' command can do. In general, the commands are pretty self-explanatory, except
#' for long algebraic notation (LAN), the move notation used by UCI. In this
#' notation, moves are recorded using the starting and ending positions of each
#' piece, e.g. e2e4, e7e5, e1g1 (white short castling), e7e8q (for promotion),
#' 0000 (nullmove).
#'
#' @section Implementation:
#' All the heavy lifting of this class is done by the `{processx}` package. The
#' Stockfish process is created with `processx::process$new` and IO is done with
#' `write_input()` and `read_output()`. An important aspect of the communication
#' protocol of any UCI engine is waiting for replies, and here this is done
#' with a loop that queries the process with `poll_io()` and stops once the
#' output comes back empty.
#'
#' Before implementing the UCI protocol manually, this package used
#' `{bigchess}`. It is a great package created by
#' [@@rosawojciech](https://github.com/rosawojciech), but it has some
#' dependencies that are beyond the scope of this package and ultimately I
#' wanted more control over the API (e.g. using `{R6}`).
#'
#' @section Common Gotchas:
#' This class has some specifics that the user should keep in mind when
#' trying to communicate with Stockfish. Some of them are due to implementation
#' choices, but others are related to the UCI protocol itself. This is by no
#' means a comprehensive list (and you should probably read
#' [UCI's documentation](http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html)), but
#' here are a few things to look out for:
#'
#' - Not every UCI method is implemented: since `{stockfish}` was made with
#' Stockfish (and mainly Stockfish 11) in mind, a couple of UCI methods that
#' don't work with the engine were not implemented. They are `debug()` and
#' `register()`.
#' - Most methods return silently: since most UCI commands don't output anything
#' or output boilerplate text, most methods of this class return silently. The
#' exceptions are `run()`, `isready()`, `go()` and `stop()`; you can see exactly
#' what they return by reading their documentations.
#' - Not every Stockfish option will work: at least when using the bundled
#' version of Stockfish, not every documented option will work with `setoption()`.
#' This happens because, as described above, this package comes with Stockfish
#' 11, which is not the most recent version. Options that will not work are
#' labeled with an asterisk.
#' - Times are in milliseconds: unlike most R functions, every method that takes
#' a time interval expects them in milliseconds, not seconds.

    #' @description Tell the engine to use the UCI.
    #'
    #' "Tell engine to use the uci (universal chess interface), this will be
    #' send once as a first command after program boot to tell the engine to
    #' switch to uci mode. After receiving the uci command the engine must
    #' identify itself with the 'id' command and sent the 'option' commands to
    #' tell the GUI which engine settings the engine supports if any. After that
    #' the engine should sent 'uciok' to acknowledge the uci mode. If no uciok
    #' is sent within a certain time period, the engine task will be killed by
    #' the GUI."
    uci = function() {
      invisible(self$run("uci"))

    #' @description Ask if the engine is ready for more commands.
    #'
    #' "This is used to synchronize the engine with the GUI. When the GUI has
    #' sent a command or multiple commands that can take some time to complete,
    #' this command can be used to wait for the engine to be ready again or to
    #' ping the engine to find out if it is still alive. E.g. this should be
    #' sent after setting the path to the tablebases as this can take some time.
    #' This command is also required once before the engine is asked to do any
    #' search to wait for the engine to finish initializing. This command must
    #' always be answered with 'readyok' and can be sent also when the engine is
    #' calculating in which case the engine should also immediately answer with
    #' 'readyok' without stopping the search."

    isready = function() {
      return(self$run("isready")[1] == "readyok")
    },

    #' @description Change the internal parameters of the engine. All currently
    #' supported options (according to Stockfish's documentation) are listed
    #' below, but note that __those marked with an * require Stockfish 12__ to
    #' work):
    #'
    #' - `Threads`: the number of CPU threads used for searching a position. For
    #' best performance, set this equal to the number of CPU cores available.
    #' - `Hash`: the size of the hash table in MB. It is recommended to set Hash
    #' after setting Threads.
    #' - `Ponder`: let Stockfish ponder its next move while the opponent is
    #' thinking.
    #' - `MultiPV`: output the N best lines (principal variations, PVs) when
    #' searching. Leave at 1 for best performance.
    #' - `Use NNUE`*: toggle between the NNUE and classical evaluation functions.
    #' If set to "true", the network parameters must be available to load from
    #' file (see also EvalFile), if they are not embedded in the binary.
    #' - `EvalFile`*: the name of the file of the NNUE evaluation parameters.
    #' Depending on the GUI the filename might have to include the full path to
    #' the folder/directory that contains the file. Other locations, such as the
    #' directory that contains the binary and the working directory, are also
    #' searched.
    #' - `UCI_AnalyseMode`: an option handled by your GUI.
    #' - `UCI_Chess960`: an option handled by your GUI. If true, Stockfish will
    #' play Chess960.
    #' - `UCI_ShowWDL`*: tf enabled, show approximate WDL statistics as part of
    #' the engine output. These WDL numbers model expected game outcomes for a
    #' given evaluation and game ply for engine self-play at fishtest LTC
    #' conditions (60+0.6s per game).
    #' - `UCI_LimitStrength`*: enable weaker play aiming for an Elo rating as set
    #' by UCI_Elo. This option overrides Skill Level.
    #' - `UCI_Elo`*: if enabled by UCI_LimitStrength, aim for an engine strength
    #' of the given Elo. This Elo rating has been calibrated at a time control of
    #' 60s+0.6s and anchored to CCRL 40/4.
    #' - `Skill Level`: lower the Skill Level in order to make Stockfish play
    #' weaker (see also UCI_LimitStrength). Internally, MultiPV is enabled, and
    #' with a certain probability depending on the Skill Level a weaker move
    #' will be played.
    #' - `SyzygyPath`: path to the folders/directories storing the Syzygy
    #' tablebase files. Multiple directories are to be separated by ";" on
    #' Windows and by ":" on Unix-based operating systems. Do not use spaces
    #' around the ";" or ":". Example:
    #' `C:\tablebases\wdl345;C:\tablebases\wdl6;D:\tablebases\dtz345;D:\tablebases\dtz6`.
    #' It is recommended to store .rtbw files on an SSD. There is no loss in
    #' storing the .rtbz files on a regular HD. It is recommended to verify all
    #' md5 checksums of the downloaded tablebase files (`md5sum -c checksum.md5`)
    #' as corruption will lead to engine crashes.
    #' - `SyzygyProbeDepth`: minimum remaining search depth for which a position
    #' is probed. Set this option to a higher value to probe less aggressively
    #' if you experience too much slowdown (in terms of nps) due to TB probing.
    #' - `Syzygy50MoveRule`: disable to let fifty-move rule draws detected by
    #' Syzygy tablebase probes count as wins or losses. This is useful for ICCF
    #' correspondence games.
    #' - `SyzygyProbeLimit`: limit Syzygy tablebase probing to positions with at
    #' most this many pieces left (including kings and pawns).
    #' - `Contempt`: a positive value for contempt favors middle game positions
    #' and avoids draws, effective for the classical evaluation only.
    #' - `Analysis Contempt`: by default, contempt is set to prefer the side to
    #' move. Set this option to "White" or "Black" to analyse with contempt for
    #' that side, or "Off" to disable contempt.
    #' - `Move Overhead`: assume a time delay of x ms due to network and GUI
    #' overheads. This is useful to avoid losses on time in those cases.
    #' - `Slow Mover`: lower values will make Stockfish take less time in games,
    #' higher values will make it think longer.
    #' - `nodestime`: tells the engine to use nodes searched instead of wall time
    #' to account for elapsed time. Useful for engine testing.
    #' - `Clear Hash`: clear the hash table.
    #' - `Debug Log File`: write all communication to and from the engine into a
    #' text file.
    #'
    #' "This is sent to the engine when the user wants to change the internal
    #' parameters of the engine. For the 'button' type no value is needed. One
    #' string will be sent for each parameter and this will only be sent when
    #' the engine is waiting. The name of the option in  should not be case
    #' sensitive and can includes spaces like also the value. The substrings
    #' 'value' and 'name' should be avoided in  and  to allow unambiguous

    #' and 'go') will be from a different game. This can be a new game the

    #' position from a testsuite with positions only. If the GUI hasn't sent a
    #' 'ucinewgame' before the first 'position' command, the engine shouldn't
    #' expect any further ucinewgame commands as the GUI is probably not
    #' supporting the ucinewgame command. So the engine should not rely on this
    #' command even though all new GUIs should support it. As the engine's
    #' reaction to 'ucinewgame' can take some time the GUI should always send
    #' 'isready' after ucinewgame to wait for the engine to finish its

    #' is needed. However, if this position is from a different game than the

    #' command. There are a number of commands that can follow this command, all
    #' will be sent in the same string. If one command is not send its value
    #' should be interpreted as it would not influence the search.
    #'
    #' - `searchmoves`: restrict search to this moves only. Example: after
    #' 'position startpos' and 'go infinite searchmoves e2e4 d2d4' the engine
    #' should only search the two moves e2e4 and d2d4 in the initial position.
    #' - `ponder`: start searching in pondering mode. Do not exit the search in
    #' ponder mode, even if it's mate! This means that the last move sent in the
    #' position string is the ponder move. The engine can do what it wants to
    #' do, but after a 'ponderhit' command it should execute the suggested move
    #' to ponder on. This means that the ponder move sent by the GUI can be
    #' interpreted as a recommendation about which move to ponder. However, if
    #' the engine decides to ponder on a different move, it should not display
    #' any mainlines as they are likely to be misinterpreted by the GUI because
    #' the GUI expects the engine to ponder on the suggested move.
    #' - `wtime`: white has x msec left on the clock.
    #' - `btime`: black has x msec left on the clock.
    #' - `winc`: white increment per move in mseconds if x > 0.
    #' - `binc`: black increment per move in mseconds if x > 0.
    #' - `movestogo`: there are x moves to the next time control, this will only
    #' be sent if x > 0, if you don't get this and get the wtime and btime it's
    #' sudden death.
    #' - `depth`: search x plies only.
    #' - `nodes`: search x nodes only.
    #' - `mate`: search for a mate in x moves.
